# ADR 002: UUID v7 for Identity
status: Accepted
date: 2026-01-30

## Context
We need to choose a Primary Key strategy for our Domain Entities. Options include Auto-Incrementing Integers, Random GUIDs (v4), or Time-Ordered GUIDs (v7).

## Decision
We will use **UUID v7** (Guid) as the standard Primary Key for all Entities.

## Rationale
-   **Sortability**: Unlike v4 GUIDs, v7 is time-ordered. This provides clustered index performance similar to Integers.
-   **Offline/Distributed Capable**: IDs can be generated by the Application (or Client) before persistence. This supports future "Offline Sync" features.
-   **Uniqueness**: Globally unique, preventing collisions if we merge data from multiple instances.

## Consequences
-   **Storage**: 16 bytes per ID vs 4 bytes (Int). Negligible for our scale.
-   **Readability**: Harder to read/type manually than `ID: 1`, but URLs and internal logic handle this.
