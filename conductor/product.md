# Product Definition: Baby Gaja Tracking Application

## Initial Concept
A minimalist .NET 9 tracking application for baby behavior data, focused on speed and data integrity.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Parents tracking their baby's daily routines to manage care and identify patterns.
- **Secondary:** Pediatricians and healthcare providers who need accurate data for medical review.
- **Tertiary:** Professional caregivers and nannies ensuring continuity of care.
