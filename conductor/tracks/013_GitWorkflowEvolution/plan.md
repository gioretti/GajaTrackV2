# Implementation Plan: Git Workflow Evolution

## Phase 1: Core Instruction Update
1. [ ] Update `GEMINI.md`:
    - Add "Branch Isolation" to Operational Guidelines.
    - Explicitly forbid direct commits to `master` for track work.
2. [ ] Update `conductor/workflow.md`:
    - Add "Git Branching & Merging Protocol" section.
    - Define specific CLI commands for the `rebase` + `merge --no-ff` flow.

## Phase 2: Orchestration Registry
1. [ ] Register Track 013 in `conductor/tracks.md`.

## Phase 3: Final Verification
1. [ ] Perform a "Dry Run" explanation of the new merge sequence.
