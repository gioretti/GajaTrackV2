# Implementation Plan: Workflow Protocol Refinement

## Phase 1: Core Refinement
1. [x] Create `git-protocol` skill with full PR lifecycle.
2. [x] Create `/complete-track` command.
3. [x] Simplify `GEMINI.md` and add OS-specific shell constraints.

## Phase 2: Integration
1. [ ] Commit all changes.
2. [ ] Push and merge.
3. [ ] Run `/complete-track` to verify the new automation.
