# Product Guidelines: Baby Gaja Tracking Application

## Tone & Voice
- **Concise & Functional:** The UI and documentation should be direct, fluff-free, and focused on efficiency. Avoid unnecessary conversational fillers or overly clinical jargon; prioritize clarity and speed of communication.

## Visual Identity & UI Design
- **High Information Density:** Maximize the visibility of relevant data at a glance. Use compact layouts, dense charts, and efficient use of space to provide a comprehensive daily overview.
- **Visual Clarity & Contrast:** Employ distinct color coding and clear visual boundaries to differentiate between activity types (e.g., Sleep, Feeding, Crying) ensuring easy scanning.
- **System-Native Aesthetic:** Leverage standard UI components and platform-appropriate design patterns to ensure a familiar, fast-loading, and responsive experience across devices.

## User Experience & Interaction
- **Speed-First Entry:** Prioritize minimal clicks/taps for common tracking actions. Use "quick-add" buttons, sensible defaults, and streamlined workflows to reduce the cognitive load on parents.
- **Context-Aware Assistance:** Implement smart suggestions and intuitive defaults based on the time of day, current baby state, and previous patterns (e.g., automatically suggesting a "Wake up" action if the state is "Asleep").
- **Layered Data Visualization:** For the 24-hour protocol, provide a high-level visual summary that allows users to drill down into precise timestamps, durations, and notes through interaction.

## Development & Operational Principles
- **Technical Excellence:** Maintain high architectural standards (DDD/Clean Architecture), rigorous testing (TDD), and clean code practices to ensure the long-term stability and integrity of baby data.
- **User-Centric Iteration:** Balance technical rigor with the need to iterate based on user feedback. Focus on delivering functional value quickly and refining the experience based on real-world parenting needs.
